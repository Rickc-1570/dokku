# 0.31.0 Migration Guide

## Changes

- Herokuish build cache is now mounted from a docker volume - eg. `cache-node-js-app` - instead of the local filesystem. All existing app cache will be cleared upon upgrading past 0.29.0.
- The `vector` container integration now mounts config to `/etc/vector` instead of the path `/etc/vector/vector.json`, allowing users the ability to provide extra configuration for Vector Sinks. To take advantage of the new functionality, the vector container should be stopped (via `dokku logs:vector-stop`) and then started (via `dokku logs:vector-start`).
- The `traefik` integration now mounts config to `/data` instead of the path `/acme.json`, fixing permissions issues under certain architectures. To take advantage of the new functionality, the traefik container should be stopped (via `dokku traefik:stop`) and then started (via `dokku traefik:start`).

## Deprecations

- The `proxy:ports*` commands have been replaced with the new `ports` plugin. Users will be able to use the old `proxy:ports*` commands for a single minor release, and they will be removed in the next minor release.

## Un-Deprecations

- The bare `apps` and `config` cli aliases are no longer deprecated. This better follows Heroku's output and is more useful to users. The subcommands will be treated as the primary, documented versions, while the aliases are there for convenience.
