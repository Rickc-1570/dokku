# 0.31.0 Migration Guide

## Changes

- Herokuish build cache is now mounted from a docker volume - eg. `cache-node-js-app` - instead of the local filesystem. All existing app cache will be cleared upon upgrading past 0.29.0.
- The `proxy:ports*` commands have been replaced with the new `ports` plugin. Users will be able to use the old `proxy:ports*` commands for a single minor release, and they will be removed in the next minor release.
