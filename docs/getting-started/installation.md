# Getting Started with Dokku

## What is Dokku?

Dokku is an extensible, Open Source Platform as a Service (PaaS) that runs on a single server of your choice.

It makes a job of deploying software to the servers easy.
You build your application from smaller elements with Docker
containers, which you wire together by configuring Dokku accordingly.
In that sense, Dokku is similar to Docker Compose, but more powerful, as it
provides additional operations, depending on what you run in the container.
If Dokku has a plugin for this service type, it can greatly enhance your
workflow.
For example, if you have a memory key-value-store in a container (Redis,
Memcache), Dokku will give you a way to dump its data for export/backup
purposes.

## Dokku 101

You install Dokku on a server and setup SSH authorization keys in its web
config interface.
Afterwards the config interface is shutdown, and the port 80 is relieved for
you use.

Dokku provides you a single command line -- `dokku`.
By running it with different parameters, such as `dokku apps:list` to list
your apps, you can achieve most of the steps required to build and deploy
modern cloud applications.

As mention above, Dokku has many plugins for popular services used in cloud
apps.
With some plugins, things such as application data management become easier.

For example, Dokku comes with MySQL and PostgresSQL modules, so not only can
you run your database securely, but also backup it correctly to a cloud
service like AWS S3.

In some sense, Dokku is similar to Heroku, with one exception: `dokku`
command line runs on the host on which it is installed, as opposed to
`heroku` command, which runs entirely on a client, without a need to "login"
to the cloud machine.

Another similarity is that `dokku` uses buildpacks used by `heroku`, and
it's the most common app development starting point.

## Quickstart

To start using Dokku, you'll need a system that meets the following minimum requirements:

- A fresh installation of [Ubuntu 16.04 x64](https://www.ubuntu.com/download), [Ubuntu 14.04 x64](https://www.ubuntu.com/download), [Debian 8.2 x64](https://www.debian.org/distrib/) or [CentOS 7 x64](https://www.centos.org/download/) *(experimental)* with the FQDN set <sup>[1]</sup>
- At least `1GB` of system memory <sup>[2]</sup>

You can *optionally* have a domain name pointed at the host's IP, though this is not necessary.

Dokku is designed for usage on a fresh VM installation, and should install all necessary dependencies if installing via the bootstrap method.

### Installing the latest stable version

#### 1. Install dokku

To install the latest stable version of dokku, you can run the following shell commands:

```shell
# for debian systems, installs Dokku via apt-get
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dokku/dokku/v0.12.7/bootstrap.sh;
sudo DOKKU_TAG=v0.12.7 bash bootstrap.sh
```

The installation process takes about 5-10 minutes, depending upon internet connection speed.

If you're using Debian 8 or Ubuntu 14.04, make sure your package manager is configured to install a sufficiently recent version of nginx<sup>[3]</sup>, otherwise, the installation may fail due to "unmet dependencies" relating nginx.

#### 2. Setup SSH key and Virtualhost Settings

Once the installation is complete, you can open a browser to setup your SSH key and virtualhost settings. Open your browser of choice and navigate to the host's IP address - or the domain you assigned to that IP previously - and configure Dokku via the web admin.

Alternatively, instructions to skip the web installer with an unattended installation are available in the [advanced install guide](/docs/getting-started/advanced-installation/#configuring). 

> **Warning:** If you don't complete setup via the web installer (even if you set up SSH keys and virtual hosts otherwise) your Dokku installation will remain vulnerable to anyone finding the setup page and inserting their key. You can check if it is still running via `ps auxf | grep dokku-installer`, and it may be stopped via your server's init system - usually either `service dokku-installer stop` or `stop dokku-installer`.

> **Warning:** Web installer is not available on CentOS and Arch Linux. You will need to configure [SSH keys](/docs/deployment/user-management.md#adding-ssh-keys) and [virtual hosts](/docs/configuration/domains.md#customizing-hostnames) using dokku command line interface - see unattended installation linked above.

#### 3. Deploy your first application

Once you save your settings, the web admin will self-terminate and you should be able to run or [deploy to the Dokku installation](/docs/deployment/application-deployment.md).

### Installing via other methods

For various reasons, certain hosting providers may have other steps that should be preferred to the above. If hosted on any of the following popular hosts, please follow the linked to instructions:

- [Digital Ocean Installation Notes](/docs/getting-started/install/digitalocean.md)
- [DreamHost Cloud Installation Notes](/docs/getting-started/install/dreamhost.md)
- [Microsoft Azure Installation Notes](/docs/getting-started/install/azure.md)

As well, you may wish to customize your installation in some other fashion. or experiment with vagrant. The guides below should get you started:

- [Debian Package Installation Notes](/docs/getting-started/install/debian.md)
- [RPM Package Installation Notes](/docs/getting-started/install/rpm.md)
- [Vagrant Installation Notes](/docs/getting-started/install/vagrant.md)
- [Advanced Install Customization](/docs/getting-started/advanced-installation.md)

- <sup>[1]: To check whether your system has an fqdn set, run `sudo hostname -f`</sup>
- <sup>[2]: If your system has less than 1GB of memory, you can use [this workaround](/docs/getting-started/advanced-installation.md#vms-with-less-than-1gb-of-memory).</sup>
- <sup>[3]: nginx >= 1.8.0 can be installed via the [nginx repositories](https://www.nginx.com/resources/admin-guide/installing-nginx-open-source/), or by adding [this PPA](https://launchpad.net/~nginx/+archive/ubuntu/stable) if you're using Ubuntu. nginx >= 1.11.5 is necessary for HTTP/2 support</sup>
